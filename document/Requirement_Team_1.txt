Requirement description

This document describes which files in the source code satisfy each of the specific requirement.

Protocol requirement:
1. Stateful: 
  i) akh_server_main.c: this file contains the main function for implementing the DFA on the server side.  
  ii) akh_client_main.c: this file contains the main function for implementing the DFA on the client side.

2. Concurrent:
  
3. Service:
   i) Makefile: in this file, we can specify a specific port number (default 9090) as the command arguments to the server.  
   ii) akh_server_main.c: in this file, we bind the server to the port number defined in Makefile.
4. Client:
   i) Makefile: in this file, we can specify a specific port number (default 9090) and the host name of the server as the command arguments passed to the client.  
   ii) akh_client_main.c: in this file, the client can send messages to the host (IP) and port number defined in Makefile.

5. UI:
